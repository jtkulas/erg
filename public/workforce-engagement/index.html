<h2>Creating an engaged workforce 💖</h2>
<p>We apply behavioral principles and methods to answer questions of employee sentiment within the broader organizational system. An important component of this systemic change process includes our engagement survey developed in partnership with <a href="https://eagle-io.weebly.com/">Eagle I.O</a>.</p>

<h2>Engagement survey 💃</h2>
<p><img src="engage.PNG" /></p>
<p>The engagement survey responses are evaluated against norms representing most major U.S. metropolitan areas, with sparser international representation (see Figure <a href="#fig:norms">1</a>). The feedback reports include both static .pdf as well as interactive .html reports and presentation slides. The .pdf and .html feedback reports are still under construction as of October, 2023. A tutorial on the use of the presentation slides is currently <a href="https://jtkulas.github.io/slides/">available here</a>.</p>
