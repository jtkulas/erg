      <description>Process automation üöÄWe help organizations transition to -enabled automated work processes. Why ? Because it is:
Powerful
Flexible
FreeWe rely on  to drive all of our internal business functions. For example, we use the platform to scrape data from websites, automate reports, and consolidate data into centralized repositories. The system that we use is generalizable - your needs are of course unique but can also be automated via application of standard principles.</description>

      <description>Professional resources üìö:We maintain libraries of resources that have been created over the years either by eg personnel or graduate students in Industrial and Organizational Psychology that have had a former association with Dr.¬†Kulas.

      <description>Assessments AuditingThe sheer volume of assessments that organizations can accumulate can be overwhelming. Over 30 years of experience in authoring, validating, and implementing assessments gives us a unique perspective regarding assessment utility.
An assessment audit evaluates the current cost and benefit of assessments used for purposes of selection, training, and employee experience. Returns on investment are calculated and the audited organization receives a comprehensive report regarding the relative cost and benefit of each individual assessment as well as the overall assessment strategy.</description>
