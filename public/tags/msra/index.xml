      <description>Assessments AuditingThe sheer volume of assessments that organizations can accumulate can be overwhelming. Over 30 years of experience in authoring, validating, and implementing assessments gives us a unique perspective regarding assessment utility.
An assessment audit evaluates the current cost and benefit of assessments used for purposes of selection, training, and employee experience. Returns on investment are calculated and the audited organization receives a comprehensive report regarding the relative cost and benefit of each individual assessment as well as the overall assessment strategy.</description>
