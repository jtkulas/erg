<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>We are a student-led consulting group within the Industrial/Organizational Psychology program at Montclair State University, founded in 2019. We look at ourselves as hard-working, driven students who wish to strengthen MSUâ€™s I/O Psych program, as well as learn outside of the classroom to build upon our skills and knowledge. We pride ourselves on strong involvement in local and national I/O groups, namely <a href="https://metroapppsych.com/">METRO</a> and <a href="https://siop.org">SIOP</a>. For more information about the roles and responsibilities of Eagle I.O, please visit our <a href="https://bookdown.org/kulasj/eagleiomanual/">Consultant Manual</a>.</p>

<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>We are responsible for executing various projects. Our main project is developing an Engagement survey, which we wish to distribute to external organizations. We also run a <a href="https://bookdown.org/kulasj/mentorship/">mentorship program</a> within the MSU I/O program, where we train most of the 2nd year graduate students to guide the new students into becoming successful students themselves. Additionally, we host a variety of events, such as new student orientation, networking opportunities, and casual hangouts.</p>
