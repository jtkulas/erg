The primary erg product is an [engagement survey](https://bookdown.org/kulasj/engagetech/). We are also working on an `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")` package to capture online survey responses.

The engagement survey has norms representing most major U.S. metropolitan areas as well as four industrial groups 

```{r norms, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Engagement survey normative information"}

## data duplicating norms frequencies (number of people in database)

library(leaflet)
library(maps)  ## us.cities data

data(us.cities)

us.cities$industry <- as.factor(sample(c("public", "private", "retail", "manufacturing"), size=1005, replace=TRUE))
  
pal <- colorFactor(
  palette = 'Spectral',
  domain = us.cities$industry
)

## create leaflet map
leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>% 
  setView(-98.35, 39.7,
          zoom = 4) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(data=us.cities, lng = ~long, lat = ~lat, weight = 1,
             radius = ~sqrt(pop) * 100, popup = ~name, fillColor=~pal(industry)) %>%
  addLegend("bottomright", data=us.cities, pal = pal, values = ~industry, opacity = 1)

```

...long term we will help organizations transition to full `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`-enabled workflows
