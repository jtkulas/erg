## Creating an engaged workforce

We apply behavioral Psychology principles and methods to answer questions of employee sentiment within the broader organizational system. An important component of this systemic change process includes our [engagement survey](https://bookdown.org/kulasj/engagetech/) developed in partnership with [Eagle I.O](https://eagle-io.weebly.com/). 

The e`r fontawesome::fa("r-project")`g team is also working on an `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")` package to capture online survey responses.  

## Engagement survey `r emo::ji("woman_dancing")` {#engage}

The engagement survey has norms representing most major U.S. metropolitan areas as well as four industrial groups. The feedback report includes html presentation slides with interactive graphics capabilities. A tutorial on the use of these slides is [available here](https://jtkulas.github.io/slides/). 

```{r Norms, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Engagement survey normative information"}

## data duplicating norms frequencies (number of people in database)

library(leaflet)
library(maps)  ## us.cities data

data(us.cities)

us.cities$industry <- as.factor(sample(c("public", "private", "retail", "manufacturing"), size=1005, replace=TRUE))
  
pal <- colorFactor(
  palette = 'Spectral',
  domain = us.cities$industry
)

## create leaflet map
norms <- leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>% 
  setView(-98.35, 39.7,
          zoom = 4) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(data=us.cities, lng = ~long, lat = ~lat, weight = 1,
             radius = ~sqrt(pop) * 200, popup = ~name, fillColor=~pal(industry)) %>%
  addLegend("bottomright", data=us.cities, pal = pal, values = ~industry, opacity = 1)

widgetframe::frameWidget(norms)
