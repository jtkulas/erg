# Professional resources `r emo::ji("books")`:{-}

We maintain libraries of resources that have been created over the years either by e`r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`g personnel or graduate students in Industrial and Organizational Psychology that have had a former association with Dr. Kulas. These resources all share a goal of furthering the advancement of Psychological assessment.

[^foot]:This website, for example, was [built with `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`](https://github.com/jtkulas/erg). Our interest was functionality and browser compatability, which is why the design is rather utilitarian, but it [does not need to be so](https://themefisher.com/hugo-business-themes).
