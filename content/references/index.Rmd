We maintain libraries of resources that have been created over the years either by e`r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`g personnel or graduate students in Industrial and Organizational Psychology that have had a former association with Dr. Kulas. These resources all share a goal of furthering the advancement of organizational surveying. A partial listing of these resources (as well as hyperlinks to the resources themselves) is presented below:

## Organizational surveying resources `r emo::ji("books")`:{-}

```{r refs, echo=FALSE}

refs <- read.csv("resources.csv")
kableExtra::kable(refs, col.names=c("",""))

```

In addition to the above listed resources, we also maintain a small YouTube channel that is focused on forensic Psychometric analyses here: [`r fontawesome::fa("youtube", fill="red")`](https://www.youtube.com/@forensicpsychometrics8300)

```{css, echo=FALSE}

}
```

[^foot]:This website, for example, was [built with `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`](https://github.com/jtkulas/erg). Our interest was functionality and browser compatability, which is why the design is rather utilitarian, but it [does not need to be so](https://themefisher.com/hugo-business-themes).
