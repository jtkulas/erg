# Teaching `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")` `r emo::ji("books")`

If you are interested in training your personnel on `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")` so that you may develop your own efficient business processes and products, we also provide training on "how to use" `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")` - just [drop us a note](https://ergreports.com/our-team/#contact).  

# Professional resources:{-}

```{r logo2, echo=FALSE, out.width= "45%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/atcqQ5PuX41J6/giphy.gif")
```

We maintain libraries of resources that have been created over the years either by e`r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`g personnel or graduate students in Industrial and Organizational Psychology that have had an association with Dr. Kulas. These resources all share a goal of furthering the advancement of testing and assessment within the framework of `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`. 

A partial listing of these resources (as well as hyperlinks to the resources themselves) is presented below: 

```{r refs, echo=FALSE}
 
refs <- read.csv("resources.csv")
kableExtra::kable(refs, col.names=c("","",""))

```

```{css, echo=FALSE}
div {
  padding-top: 15px;
  padding-right: 0px;
  padding-bottom: 15px;
  padding-left: 0px;
}
```

<div id="refs"></div>
