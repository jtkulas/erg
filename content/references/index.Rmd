## `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`-driven processes `r emo::ji("rocket")`

We provide consultation on statistical and psychometric projects as well as helping organizations transition to `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`-enabled workflows. Why `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`? Because it is:  

+ Powerful  
+ Flexible  
+ Free  
  
This platform has the capability to power many business functions. This website, for example, was [built with `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`](https://github.com/jtkulas/erg).[^foot] With e`r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`g's help, your business can transition business processes to this platform that greatly minimizes overhead costs - this is the primary reason our clients find that our prices come in on the "low end" of bids.  

[^foot]:Our interest was functionality and browser compatability, which is why the design is rather utilitarian, but it [does not need to be so](https://themefisher.com/hugo-business-themes).

## Teaching `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`

If you are interested in training your personnel on `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")` so that you may develop your own `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`-powered business processes and products, we also provide training on "how to use" `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")` - just [drop us a note](mailto:jtkulas@ergreports.com). 

## Free industry resources

A partial listing of these resources (as well as hyperlinks to the resources themselves) is presented below:
