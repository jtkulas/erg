# Professional resources `r emo::ji("books")`:{-}

We maintain libraries of resources that have been created over the years either by e`r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`g personnel or graduate students in Industrial and Organizational Psychology that have had a former association with Dr. Kulas. These resources all share a goal of furthering the advancement of testing and assessment. A partial listing of these resources (as well as hyperlinks to the resources themselves) is presented below:

```{r refs, echo=FALSE}

refs <- read.csv("resources.csv")
kableExtra::kable(refs, col.names=c("","",""))

```

```{css, echo=FALSE}
div {
  padding-top: 15px;
  padding-right: 0px;
  padding-bottom: 15px;
  padding-left: 0px;
}
```
