A partial listing of these resources (as well as hyperlinks to the resources themselves) is presented below:

```{r refs, echo=FALSE}

refs <- read.csv("resources.csv")
kableExtra::kable(refs, col.names=c("",""))

```

In addition to the above listed resources, we also maintain a (very nascent) YouTube channel that is focused on forensic Psychometric analyses: [`r fontawesome::fa("youtube", fill="red")`](https://www.youtube.com/@forensicpsychometrics8300)
